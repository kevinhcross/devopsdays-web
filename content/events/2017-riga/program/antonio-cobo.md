<p><em>The DevOps movement is gradually changing IT organisations. Project managers are often forgotten, but they also need to change. Are project managers ready for the DevOps change?</em></p>

<p>The wall between Dev and Ops has now broken thanks to DevOps, but there are other walls needed to be broken. One of them is between developers and project managers, making the communication and understanding between them difficult. We need to break this wall as the project manager needs to work alongside the DevOps team in order to help the company to change the old mindset and working together sharing goals and responsibilities.</p>

<p><strong>Agenda</strong>:
