<p><em>Big data, data science, machine learning is coming to a lot of companies. Everyone is used to the creation of ordinary software, but BD/DS/ML requires special care. Managers and developers may get unfamiliar problems and I want to tell you about them and solutions - no money and nerves should be wasted.</em></p>

<p>Everyone has heard of data science, machine learning and big data. Many companies are starting to build up teams and run projects. Everyone knows how to develop, deliver and deploy ordinary software, but data-driven software is a different animal. Scientists, developers and managers may not be familiar with the issues that may come up.</p>
