<p><em>Creating a fast flow in the value delivery stream and enabling feedback loops are at the core of DevOps ideas and principles. The talk discusses the issue and presents a solution for automating the flow and monitoring capability of information artefacts that represent the state of an ongoing project.</em></p>

<p>"To build the right product it is critical for the developer to receive timely feedback from the end-user or the business or product owner. Feedback is needed because writing perfect requirements beforehand and then delivering the needed software has proved to be extremely difficult. In the words of Martin Fowler, the co-author of the original Agile Manifesto: “…it's very hard to specify what you want in advance and be correct; people find it much easier to see something that's not quite right and say how it needs to be changed.” Not only feedback itself is important, but also its qualities like regularity, speed, context, precision and also the ease of tracking it.</p>

<p>The speech focuses on enabling regular, fast and precise feedback by integrating and synchronizing work environments of separated product/business and development teams. In particular, we look at a government case study where separation is more acute, because the developer is outsourced through a contracted development company. "</p>
