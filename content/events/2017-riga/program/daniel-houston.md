<p><em>The Docker socket is insecure when mounted through to containers, allowing subsequent contains to escape the docker model and root the docker host.</em></p>

<p>Many use Docker in their CI pipelines; but few everyday users are aware of the security issues surrounding the docker socket on docker hosts and the complications this brings. I want to highlight one such issue with the docker socket when creating docker containers within docker containers.</p>
