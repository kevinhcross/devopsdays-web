<p><em>A fast-moving, outside-in talk that 'sells' the value of DevOps to business executives, finds the weakest link in the value stream and explores the often troubled relationship between IT people and normal people (the business).</em></p>

<p>There is much hype around DevOps, so what are we actually talking about?
DevOps improved Agile by speeding up deployment (and more). But how do you 'sell' DevOps to business executives who don't understand IT?</p>
<p>No business value is realized until the users actually use the systems well. This is often the weakest link in the IT value chain, so you need to extend your scope.</p>
<p>Collaboration is difficult and collaboration between business and IT even more so. What kind of behaviour is effective? Learn from workshop results from practitioners in 11 countries.</p>
<p>But why "Kill DevOps"? This refers to an ancient Zen saying about a monk’s journey towards enlightenment and awakening. If you think that you’ve found Buddha, think again, because you never will. It’s the same with DevOps: it’s about continuous experimentation and learning.</p>
