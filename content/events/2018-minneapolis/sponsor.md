Devopsdays is a self-organizing conference for practitioners that depends on sponsorships. As stated in the [global sponsorship guidelines](https://www.devopsdays.org/sponsor/), we do not sell product presentations or distribute attendee contact lists. Sponsors have the opportunity to make short elevator pitches during the program and will get recognition on the website and social media. Sponsors are encouraged to represent themselves by actively participating and engaging with the attendees as peers.

All platinum, gold, and silver sponsors get a full table where they can interact with attendees during breaks. All attendees including sponsors are welcome to propose any subject for discussion during the open space breakout sessions, but you'll make a better impression by encouraging discussion than you will by pitching a product. Keep the pitches for use at your table, while in open space you can share, listen, and learn.
