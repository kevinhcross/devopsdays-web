In this tale I will describe;

---> Background of me, working originally along side biologists who were working on ADAM which was automating drug discovery.

---> Discuss recent project I was on where I made it as "hands off" as possible. The reasons for tackling he project the way I did, the constraints, limits, etc. We will touch on the outcome, how things could have been done better, and the tough parts.

---> Why technologists shouldn't be afraid of automation, and why we should be embracing it. This is what we've been doing for 40 years or so-- and that this is "nothing new, nor unusual." And how the only way for us to move forward in technology is to ... automate what we're currently doing, removing the tedious, low-value work, so that you can do more interesting things.”

And if I have time; 

---> Abstracting above "automation" -- what's next?

Bio:
Jessica is bad about writing bios about herself. But when she's not hiding under a duvet trying to figure out what to say in these boxes, she's organising DevOpsDays Sthlm and DevOps Stockholm meetup. She's been part of the community for over 5 years, with many more in operations and engineering.
