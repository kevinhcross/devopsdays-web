We live in a world of agile and autonomous teams and devops culture,
where meritocracy and consensus rule the scene. What are the aspects of
the technical team lead role, or however you name it?

 - The person is not the one calling the shots
 - The person in this role does not assign work
 - So - what is that role really for?

In this talk I will show what a technical team lead role is and why it
is important. I will set the guidelines and generic objectives for that
role. Whether you are a team lead or a team member this talk will tell
you how you can lead. This is not a teoretical presentation but rather
well tested and tried at Criteo where i wor as a team lead.
