It’s not possible to convert money to culture. Neither buying a “DevOps” tool or hiring a “DevOps” team will give your organization the benefits you’re hoping for.

In this talk Ken will clarify some terms and talk about how to drive real change in your organization.

Some of the topics covered…

* Patterns for driving change when working with humans
* Technical requirements for effective continuous delivery
* Roles in a DevOps culture
