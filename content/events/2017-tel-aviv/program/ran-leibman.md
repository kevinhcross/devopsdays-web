<h4>What Are We Going To Play With?</h4>

<p>In this workshop we are going to dive deep into how system calls work and understand what is happening under the hood.
We will play with a unix-like operating system named <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2012/xv6.html">xv6</a> which is being used as an OS for teaching purposes.</p>

<h4>What Will We Do?</h4>

<ol>
  <li>understand what are system calls and why we need them</li>
  <li>understand the facilities used to implement systems calls in x86 architecture</li>
  <li>what happens during that magical context switch</li>
  <li>implement our own system call to xv6 and hack the xv6 OS</li>
</ol>

<h4>Is There Something I Need To Know Before Attending?</h4>

<p>Yes, you should:</p>

<ol>
  <li>have a VERY BASIC understanding of the C programming language. feel free to read <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_basic_syntax.htm">this short tutorial</a> for a quick refresh.</li>
  <li>have a VERY VERY BASIC understanding of the <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/X86_Assembly/GAS_Syntax">At&amp;t x86 assembly language</a>. feel free to read <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/assembly_programming/assembly_basic_syntax.htm">this short tutorial</a> for a quick refresh.</li>
