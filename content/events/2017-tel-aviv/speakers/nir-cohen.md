I'm primarily an innovative, think-tank type of guy who adores challenges and has an extremely strong affinity to automation and system architecture.

Extremely efficient under heavy, intensive load, I'm literally a multi-tasker in the sense that I'm able to keep many projects at bay while keeping productivity up to a maximum.

I'm very much DevOps driven and am empowering the movement by being one of the organizers of DevOpsDays TLV and by constantly attempting to apply DevOps practices in my working environment.
