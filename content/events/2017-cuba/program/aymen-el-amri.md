3 years ago Docker was not a must-know technology for DevOps professionals. 
In just one year, Docker became a technology that every DevOps professional 
should have in his CV.  How to become a DevOps professional ? My response to this 
question in 2017 will not be the same in 2018.

So how DevOps ecosystem involved during the last 5 years ? What is the roadmap 
to becoming a DevOps professional in 2017 and what are the changes that 2018 will 
bring to the DevOps ecosystem ?

This talk is inspired by a serie of articles that I published in my blog that 
got more than 35k reads in less than 6 months.
