We believe that in today’s fast moving world, it’s more important than ever 
that infrastructure and software changes are repeatable and can be done with 
confidence. To support a scalable platform for applications, teams must be 
able to make changes quickly and reliably. This isn’t limited to applications, 
but potentially even more important for infrastructure changes that 
historically have had a less formal testing process. To ensure this, 
teams must both keep their code and infrastructure definitions in source 
control, use a pipeline for deployment, and have tests to validate their 
changes. We will walk participants through the basics of version control 
for infrastructure changes, using a variety of options, and show how these 
changes can be pushed through a pipeline that includes testing.
