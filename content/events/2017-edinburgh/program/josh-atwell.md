Keeping up with the brisk pace of change requires a steady stream of investment of your time and energy. While this motivates us, it also takes a negative toll on our lives. How do you stay in the forefront while maintaining some element of balance in your overall life?
In this talk I'll share my story of investment as a baseline for discussion. I'll share how I came to make key choices at different points in my career. I'll discuss how it effected (and still effects) my family, my relationships, and my career. My goal is to open up dialog and make us more comfortable discussing this topic.
