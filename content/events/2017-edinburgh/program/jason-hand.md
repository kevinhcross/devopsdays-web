Many organizations have found great value in retrospective analysis following incidents that impact the reliability and availability of a service. Known as postmortems, companies routinely analyze what went wrong in retrospect. 

However, common approaches to postmortems are often short-sighted in their focus and rarely bring about any real improvements to our overall systems. Commonly viewed as a required exercise to cover your butt or to provide a report to management, most focus solely on root cause and suggested fixes. 

This talk will point out the true value of a postmortem, how to perform them for maximum exposure of improvements for every organizations people, process, and technology.

Audience challenges & takeaways: 

- What's broken about current methods of postmortem exercises?
- Why is a "just culture" important?
- What is the true purpose of a postmortem?
- What are the key component of a postmortem exercise?
