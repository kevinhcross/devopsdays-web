New systems are always interesting targets since their security model couldnâ€™t mature yet. NoSQL databases are no exception and had some lurid articles about their security, but how does their protection actually look like? We will take a look at three widely used systems and their unique approaches:
* MongoDB: Widely criticized for publicly accessible databases and a common victim of ransomware. Actually, it provides an elaborate authentication and authorization system, which we will cover from a historic perspective and put an emphasis on the current state.
* Redis: Security through obscurity or how you can rename commands. And it features a unique tradeoff for binding to publicly accessible interfaces.
* Elasticsearch: Groovy scripting has been a constant headache, but the new, custom-built scripting language Painless tries to take the pain away literally.
