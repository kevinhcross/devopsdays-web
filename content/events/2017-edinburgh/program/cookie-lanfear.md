Cookie would like to review her findings and experience coming from a non-engineering background to changing careers through CodeClan, an intensive software development boot camp to obtaining a great opportunity at Adobe as a Junior DevOps Engineer.

With the need for skills and people with those skills, we as a tech community need to be able to facilitate and understand how we will meet those needs.

This talk can be seen as advice to her past self and future Junior DevOps engineers just starting out, things she has learned and that she needed to learn:
What is DevOps? What does DevOps even mean? 
Flashy words are intimidating at first
Keep developing with programming languages
